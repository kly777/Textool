# Abduction: The General Idea

## 1.1 Deduction, induction, abduction

Abduction is normally thought of as being one of three major types of inference, the other two being **deduction** and **induction**. The distinction between deduction, on the one hand, and induction and abduction, on the other hand, corresponds to the distinction between necessary and non-necessary inferences.

In **deductive inferences**, what is inferred is necessarily true if the premises from which it is inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. A familiar type of example is inferences instantiating the schema:

```
All As are Bs.
a is an A.
Hence, a is a B.
```

But not all inferences are of this variety. Consider, for instance, the inference of “John is rich” from “John lives in Chelsea” and “Most people living in Chelsea are rich.” Here, the truth of the first sentence is not guaranteed (but only made likely) by the joint truth of the second and third sentences. Differently put, it is not necessarily the case that if the premises are true, then so is the conclusion: it is logically compatible with the truth of the premises that John is a member of the minority of non-rich inhabitants of Chelsea. The case is similar regarding your inference to the conclusion that Tim and Harry are friends again on the basis of the information that they have been seen jogging together. Perhaps Tim and Harry are former business partners who still had some financial matters to discuss, however much they would have liked to avoid this, and decided to combine this with their daily exercise; this is compatible with their being firmly decided never to make up.

It is standard practice to group non-necessary inferences into inductive and abductive ones. **Inductive inferences** form a somewhat heterogeneous class, but for present purposes they may be characterized as those inferences that are based purely on statistical data, such as observed frequencies of occurrences of a particular feature in a given population. An example of such an inference would be this:

```
96 per cent of the Flemish college students speak both Dutch and French.
Louise is a Flemish college student.
Hence, Louise speaks both Dutch and French.
```

However, the relevant statistical information may also be more vaguely given, as in the premise, “Most people living in Chelsea are rich.” (There is much discussion about whether the conclusion of an inductive argument can be stated in purely qualitative terms or whether it should be a quantitative one—for instance, that it holds with a probability of .96 that Louise speaks both Dutch and French—or whether it can sometimes be stated in qualitative terms—for instance, if the probability that it is true is high enough—and sometimes not. On these and other issues related to induction, see Kyburg 1990 (Ch. 4). It should also be mentioned that Harman (1965) conceives induction as a special type of abduction. See also Weintraub 2013 for discussion.)

The mere fact that an inference is based on statistical data is not enough to classify it as an inductive one. You may have observed many gray elephants and no non-gray ones, and infer from this that all elephants are gray, because that would provide the best explanation for why you have observed so many gray elephants and no non-gray ones. This would be an instance of an abductive inference. It suggests that the best way to distinguish between induction and abduction is this: both are ampliative, meaning that the conclusion goes beyond what is (logically) contained in the premises (which is why they are non-necessary inferences), but in abduction there is an implicit or explicit appeal to explanatory considerations, whereas in induction there is not; in induction, there is only an appeal to observed frequencies or statistics. (I emphasize “only,” because in abduction there may also be an appeal to frequencies or statistics, as the example about the elephants exhibits.)

A noteworthy feature of abduction, which it shares with induction but not with deduction, is that it violates **monotonicity**, meaning that it may be possible to infer abductively certain conclusions from a subset of a set S of premises which cannot be inferred abductively from S as a whole. For instance, adding the premise that Tim and Harry are former business partners who still have some financial matters to discuss, to the premises that they had a terrible row some time ago and that they were just seen jogging together may no longer warrant you to infer that they are friends again, even if—let us suppose—the last two premises alone do warrant that inference. The reason is that what counts as the best explanation of Tim and Harry’s jogging together in light of the original premises may no longer do so once the information has been added that they are former business partners with financial matters to discuss.

## 1.2 The ubiquity of abduction

You happen to know that Tim and Harry have recently had a terrible row that ended their friendship. Now someone tells you that she just saw Tim and Harry jogging together. The best explanation for this that you can think of is that they made up. You conclude that they are friends again.

One morning you enter the kitchen to find a plate and cup on the table, with breadcrumbs and a pat of butter on it, and surrounded by a jar of jam, a pack of sugar, and an empty carton of milk. You conclude that one of your house-mates got up at night to make him- or herself a midnight snack and was too tired to clear the table. This, you think, best explains the scene you are facing. To be sure, it might be that someone burgled the house and took the time to have a bite while on the job, or a house-mate might have arranged the things on the table without having a midnight snack but just to make you believe that someone had a midnight snack. But these hypotheses strike you as providing much more contrived explanations of the data than the one you infer to.

Walking along the beach, you see what looks like a picture of Winston Churchill in the sand. It could be that, as in the opening pages of Hilary Putnam’s book **Reason, Truth, and History**, (1981), what you see is actually the trace of an ant crawling on the beach. The much simpler, and therefore (you think) much better, explanation is that someone intentionally drew a picture of Churchill in the sand. That, in any case, is what you come away believing.

In these examples, the conclusions do not follow logically from the premises. For instance, it does not follow logically that Tim and Harry are friends again from the premises that they had a terrible row which ended their friendship and that they have just been seen jogging together; it does not even follow, we may suppose, from all the information you have about Tim and Harry. Nor do you have any useful statistical data about friendships, terrible rows, and joggers that might warrant an inference from the information that you have about Tim and Harry to the conclusion that they are friends again, or even to the conclusion that, probably (or with a certain probability), they are friends again. What leads you to the conclusion, and what according to a considerable number of philosophers may also warrant this conclusion, is precisely the fact that Tim and Harry’s being friends again would, if true, best explain the fact that they have just been seen jogging together. (The proviso that a hypothesis be true if it is to explain anything is taken as read from here on.) Similar remarks apply to the other two examples. The type of inference exhibited here is called **abduction** or, somewhat more commonly nowadays, **Inference to the Best Explanation**.

The distinction between deduction, on the one hand, and induction and abduction, on the other hand, corresponds to the distinction between necessary and non-necessary inferences.

- In **deductive inferences**, what is inferred is necessarily true if the premises from which it is inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. A familiar type of example is inferences instantiating the schema:

    ```

The reason is that what counts as the best explanation of Tim and Harry’s jogging together in light of the original premises may no longer do so once the information has been added that they are former business partners with financial matters to discuss.

### 1.2 The Ubiquity of Abduction

The type of inference exemplified in the cases described at the beginning of this entry will strike most as entirely familiar. Philosophers as well as psychologists tend to agree that **abduction** is frequently employed in everyday reasoning. Sometimes our reliance on abductive reasoning is quite obvious and explicit. But in some daily practices, it may be so routine and automatic that it easily goes unnoticed.

- A case in point may be our trust in other people’s testimony, which has been said to rest on abductive reasoning; see Harman 1965, Adler 1994, Fricker 1994, and Lipton 1998 for defenses of this claim. For instance, according to Jonathan Adler (1994, 274f), "[t]he best explanation for why the informant asserts that P is normally that … he believes it for duly responsible reasons and … he intends that I shall believe it too," which is why we are normally justified in trusting the informant’s testimony. This may well be correct, even though in coming to trust a person’s testimony one does not normally seem to be aware of any abductive reasoning going on in one’s mind.

- Similar remarks may apply to what some hold to be a further, possibly even more fundamental, role of **abduction** in linguistic practice, to wit, its role in determining what a speaker means by an utterance. Specifically, it has been argued that decoding utterances is a matter of inferring the best explanation of why someone said what he or she said in the context in which the utterance was made. Even more specifically, authors working in the field of pragmatics have suggested that hearers invoke the Gricean maxims of conversation to help them work out the best explanation of a speaker’s utterance whenever the semantic content of the utterance is insufficiently informative for the purposes of the conversation, or is too informative, or off-topic, or implausible, or otherwise odd or inappropriate.

**Abductive reasoning** is not limited to everyday contexts. Quite the contrary: philosophers of science have argued that **abduction** is a cornerstone of scientific methodology; see, for instance, Boyd 1981, 1984, Harré 1986, 1988, Lipton 1991, 2004, and Psillos 1999. According to Timothy Williamson (2007), "[t]he abductive methodology is the best science provides" and Ernan McMullin (1992) even goes so far to call abduction "the inference that makes science."

To illustrate the use of **abduction** in science, we consider two examples:

1. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was discovered that the orbit of Uranus, one of the seven planets known at the time, departed from the orbit as predicted on the basis of Isaac Newton’s theory of universal gravitation and the auxiliary assumption that there were no further planets in the solar system. One possible explanation was, of course, that Newton’s theory is false. Given its great empirical successes for (then) more than two centuries, that did not appear to be a very good explanation. Two astronomers, John Couch Adams and Urbain Leverrier, instead suggested (independently of each other but almost simultaneously) that there was an eighth, as yet undiscovered planet in the solar system; that, they thought, provided the best explanation of Uranus’ deviating orbit. Not much later, this planet, which is now known as "Neptune," was discovered.

2. The second example concerns what is now commonly regarded to have been the discovery of the electron by the English physicist Joseph John Thomson. Thomson had conducted experiments on cathode rays in order to determine whether they are streams of charged particles. He concluded that they are indeed, reasoning as follows:

    ```
    As the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity, are deflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively electrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way in which this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving along the path of these rays, I can see no escape from the conclusion that they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of matter.
    ```

    The conclusion that cathode rays consist of negatively charged particles does not follow logically from the reported experimental results, nor could Thomson draw on any relevant statistical data. That nevertheless he could "see no escape from the conclusion" is, we may safely assume, because the conclusion is the best—in this case presumably even the only plausible—explanation of his results that he could think of.

Many other examples of scientific uses of **abduction** have been discussed in the literature; see, for instance, Harré 1986, 1988 and Lipton 1991, 2004. **Abduction** is also said to be the predominant mode of reasoning in medical diagnosis: physicians tend to go for the hypothesis that best explains the patient’s symptoms (see Josephson and Josephson (eds.) 1994, 9–12; see also Dragulinescu 2016 on abductive reasoning in the context of medicine).

Last but not least, **abduction** plays a central role in some important philosophical debates. See Shalkowski 2010 on the place of abduction in metaphysics (also Bigelow 2010), Krzyżanowska, Wenmackers, and Douven 2014 and Douven 2016a for a possible role of abduction in the semantics of conditionals, and Williamson 2017 for an application of abduction in the philosophy of logic. Arguably, however, **abduction** plays its most notable philosophical role in epistemology and in the philosophy of science, where it is frequently invoked in objections to so-called underdetermination arguments.

## 2. Explicating Abduction

# Abduction: The Modern Sense

## Introduction

In the philosophical literature, the term **abduction** is used in two related but different senses. In both senses, the term refers to some form of explanatory reasoning. However, in the historically first sense, it refers to the place of explanatory reasoning in generating hypotheses, while in the sense most frequently used in modern literature, it refers to the place of explanatory reasoning in justifying hypotheses. In the latter sense, abduction is also often called "Inference to the Best Explanation."

This entry focuses exclusively on abduction in the modern sense, though a supplement discusses its historical origins in Charles Sanders Peirce's work—see the  
    Supplement: Peirce on Abduction.

See also the entry on scientific discovery, particularly the section on discovery as abduction.

Most philosophers agree that abduction (in the sense of Inference to the Best Explanation) is a type of inference frequently employed, in some form or another, both in everyday and scientific reasoning. However, the exact form and normative status of abduction remain controversial topics. This entry contrasts abduction with other types of inference; highlights prominent uses of it, both within and outside philosophy; considers various more or less precise statements of it; discusses its normative status; and explores possible connections between abduction and Bayesian confirmation theory.

## 1. Abduction: The General Idea

### 1.1 Deduction, Induction, Abduction

Abduction is typically thought of as one of three major types of inference, alongside deduction and induction. The distinction between deduction, on the one hand, and induction and abduction, on the other, corresponds to the distinction between necessary and non-necessary inferences.

- **Deductive Inferences**: What is inferred is necessarily true if the premises from which it is inferred are true. For example:

    ```
    All As are Bs.
    a is an A.
    Hence, a is a B.
    ```

- **Non-Necessary Inferences**: These include induction and abduction. Consider the inference of "John is rich" from "John lives in Chelsea" and "Most people living in Chelsea are rich." Here, the truth of the conclusion is not guaranteed by the premises.

Inductive inferences are based purely on statistical data, such as observed frequencies of occurrences in a given population. For instance:
    ```
96 percent of Flemish college students speak both Dutch and French.
    Louise is a Flemish college student.
    Hence, Louise speaks both Dutch and French.
    ```

However, not all non-necessary inferences are inductive. Some involve explanatory considerations, distinguishing them as abductive inferences. For example, inferring that all elephants are gray because observing many gray elephants and no non-gray ones provides the best explanation.

A key feature of abduction, shared with induction but not deduction, is that it violates monotonicity. This means that adding information can invalidate previous conclusions. For instance, if Tim and Harry were former business partners discussing financial matters, this might override the inference that they are friends again.

### 1.2 The Ubiquity of Abduction

The type of inference exemplified in the cases described at the beginning of this entry is familiar to most people. Philosophers and psychologists agree that abduction is frequently employed in everyday reasoning. Sometimes our reliance on abductive reasoning is explicit, but in some daily practices, it may be so routine and automatic that it goes unnoticed.

For example, trust in other people's testimony has been argued to rest on abductive reasoning. Jonathan Adler suggests that "[t]he best explanation for why the informant asserts that P is normally that ... he believes it for duly responsible reasons and ... he intends that I shall believe it too," justifying our trust in testimony.

Abduction also plays a role in determining what a speaker means by an utterance. Decoding utterances involves inferring the best explanation for why someone said what they did in a specific context.

In scientific contexts, philosophers argue that abduction is central to scientific methodology. Examples include:

- The discovery of Neptune, explained by positing an eighth planet affecting Uranus' orbit.
- J.J. Thomson's inference that cathode rays consist of negatively charged particles, based on experimental results.

Abduction is also prominent in medical diagnosis, where physicians tend to favor hypotheses that best explain a patient's symptoms.

Finally, abduction plays a central role in philosophical debates, particularly in epistemology and the philosophy of science. It is invoked in responses to underdetermination arguments, which claim that multiple hypotheses can equally account for the evidence, making belief in any one unwarranted.

## 2. Explicating Abduction

Precise statements of what abduction amounts to are rare in the literature. Its core idea is often summarized as the notion that explanatory considerations have confirmation-theoretic import, or that explanatory success is a mark of truth. However, these formulations are vague and can be interpreted in various ways.

### Textbook Version of Abduction

In textbooks, abduction is often formulated as:

**ABD1**  
    Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,..., Hn of E, infer the truth of that Hi which best explains E.

This rule presupposes the notions of "candidate explanation" and "best explanation," neither of which has a straightforward interpretation. Theoretical virtues like simplicity, generality, and coherence with established theories are often invoked to determine the best explanation, but these concepts are poorly understood.

Many critics argue that ABD1 is too strong. Variants propose inferring only the probable truth, approximate truth, or probable approximate truth of the best explanation.

### Problems with ABD1

ABduction is ampliative, meaning it does not guarantee true conclusions even when premises are true. For ABD1 to be reliable, it must hold that typically, the best explanation relative to the considered hypotheses would also be the best compared to any conceivable hypothesis. This requirement is rarely fulfilled, as assuming privileged access to the absolutely best explanation is implausible.

One response suggests expanding the set of hypotheses to cover logical space completely. For example, if H1,...,Hn are the candidate explanations, define Hn+1 := ¬H1 ∧ ... ∧ ¬Hn. While this ensures exhaustiveness, Hn+1 is often uninformative and unclear in its empirical consequences.

### Alternative Formulations

Two general options address the issues with ABD1:

1. **Absolute Premise Requirement**: Modify the rule to require an absolute premise. For instance:
    **ABD2**  
        Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,..., Hn of E, infer the truth of that Hi which explains E best, provided Hi is satisfactory/good enough qua explanation.

    This requires a criterion for satisfactoriness, which remains elusive.

2. **Symmetric or Congruous Version**: Formulate a version sanctioning only a comparative conclusion from a comparative premise:
    **ABD3**  
        Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,..., Hn of E, if Hi explains E better than any of the other hypotheses, infer that Hi is closer to the truth than any of the other hypotheses.

    ABD3 necessitates an account of closeness to the truth, for which multiple proposals exist today.

# Abduction: The Modern Sense

## 1. Abduction: The General Idea

### 1.1 Deduction, Induction, Abduction

Abduction is one of the three major types of inference alongside deduction and induction.

- **Deduction**: In deductive inferences, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. For example:
  - All As are Bs.
  - a is an A.
  - Hence, a is a B.

- **Induction**: Inductive inferences are based on statistical data or observed frequencies. For instance:
  - 96% of Flemish college students speak both Dutch and French.
  - Louise is a Flemish college student.
  - Hence, Louise speaks both Dutch and French.

- **Abduction**: Abductive reasoning involves inferring the best explanation for a given set of observations. For example:
  - Tim and Harry had a terrible row that ended their friendship.
  - Someone says they just saw Tim and Harry jogging together.
  - You conclude that Tim and Harry made up and are friends again because it best explains their jogging together.

### 1.2 The Ubiquity of Abduction

Abductive reasoning is pervasive in everyday life and scientific contexts:

- **Everyday Reasoning**: People often use abduction to interpret situations, such as trusting someone's testimony because it provides the best explanation for their statements (Harman 1965, Adler 1994, Fricker 1994, Lipton 1998).

- **Scientific Methodology**: Philosophers of science argue that abduction plays a central role in scientific discovery and theory selection. Examples include:
  - The discovery of Neptune: Adams and Leverrier suggested the existence of an eighth planet to explain Uranus' orbit deviations.
  - Thomson's identification of electrons: He concluded cathode rays consist of negatively charged particles based on experimental results.

- **Medical Diagnosis**: Physicians frequently use abduction to infer the most likely diagnosis based on symptoms.

- **Philosophical Debates**: Abduction is used to counter underdetermination arguments in epistemology and philosophy of science. For instance, it is argued that explanatory considerations can help distinguish between empirically equivalent hypotheses.

## 2. Explicating Abduction

Precise formulations of abduction are rare, but several possible explications exist:

### Textbook Version (ABD1)

Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,...,Hn of E, infer the truth of that Hi which best explains E.

#### Criticisms

- **Ambiguity**: Terms like "candidate explanation" and "best explanation" lack clear definitions.
- **Reliability Issues**: ABD1 assumes that the best explanation among considered hypotheses is typically the absolute best explanation, which is implausible without additional justification.

### Modified Versions

- **ABD2**: Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,...,Hn of E, infer the truth of Hi provided Hi is satisfactory/good enough qua explanation.
  - Requires a criterion for satisfactoriness or goodness.

- **ABD3**: Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,...,Hn of E, if Hi explains E better than any other hypothesis, infer that Hi is closer to the truth than any other hypothesis.
  - Requires an account of closeness to the truth.

## 3. The Status of Abduction

### 3.1 Criticisms

- **Van Fraassen's Objections**:
  - **Explanatory vs. Informative**: More explanatory theories are not necessarily more likely to be true, challenging the core idea of abduction.
  - **Probabilistic Coherence**: Probabilistic versions of abduction either reduce to Bayes' rule or risk probabilistic incoherence.

### 3.2 Defenses

Empirical defenses suggest that abduction might perform better than alternative rules in specific contexts:

- **Reliability**: Some probabilistic versions of abduction may approach the truth faster on average compared to Bayesian methods.
- **Coherence as Package Property**: Coherence should be evaluated across packages of epistemic and decision-theoretic rules rather than individually.

While abduction faces significant challenges, its utility in various domains suggests it remains a valuable tool for reasoning.

# Abductive Reasoning and Its Role in Everyday and Scientific Contexts

## Everyday Applications of Abductive Reasoning

- Philosophers and psychologists agree that **abduction** is frequently employed in everyday reasoning.
- Sometimes reliance on abductive reasoning is explicit, while in other daily practices, it may be so routine that it goes unnoticed.
- A case in point is the trust in other people’s testimony, which has been argued to rest on abductive reasoning (Harman 1965, Adler 1994, Fricker 1994, Lipton 1998).
- According to Jonathan Adler (1994, 274f), "The best explanation for why the informant asserts that P is normally that… he believes it for duly responsible reasons and… he intends that I shall believe it too," justifying our trust in testimony.
- Similar remarks apply to the role of abduction in determining what a speaker means by an utterance. Decoding utterances involves inferring the best explanation of why someone said what they did in a given context.

## Scientific Applications of Abductive Reasoning

- Philosophers of science argue that abduction is central to scientific methodology (Boyd 1981, 1984, Harré 1986, 1988, Lipton 1991, 2004, Psillos 1999).
- Timothy Williamson (2007) claims, "The abductive methodology is the best science provides."
- Ernan McMullin (1992) even calls abduction "the inference that makes science."

### Example: Discovery of Neptune

- In the early 19th century, Uranus' orbit deviated from predictions based on Newton's theory of universal gravitation.
- John Couch Adams and Urbain Leverrier suggested that an eighth, undiscovered planet explained Uranus' deviation. This led to the discovery of Neptune.

### Example: Discovery of the Electron

- Joseph John Thomson conducted experiments on cathode rays to determine if they are streams of charged particles.
- His conclusion, that cathode rays consist of negatively charged particles, was not logically derived but considered the best explanation of his results.

- Many other examples of scientific uses of abduction have been discussed (Harré 1986, 1988, Lipton 1991, 2004).

## Philosophical Debates Involving Abduction

- Abduction plays a central role in debates in metaphysics (Shalkowski 2010, Bigelow 2010), semantics of conditionals (Krzyżanowska, Wenmackers, Douven 2014, Douven 2016a), and philosophy of logic (Williamson 2017).
- It is frequently invoked in objections to underdetermination arguments, such as Cartesian skepticism and scientific antirealism.

# Explicating Abduction

## Core Idea

- Explanatory considerations have confirmation-theoretic import or explanatory success is a mark of truth.
- These formulations can be cashed out in various prima facie plausible ways.

### Textbook Version of Abduction (ABD1)

Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,…, Hn of E, infer the truth of that Hi which best explains E.

- Issues:
  - Presupposes notions of candidate explanation and best explanation, neither of which has a straightforward interpretation.
  - May warrant only probable truth, approximate truth, or probable approximate truth.

### Problems with ABD1

- Abduction is ampliative, so it cannot be a sound rule of inference in the strict logical sense.
- Reliability requires that when H best explains E and E is true, H is also true (or approximately/probably true).
- The set of candidate explanations must typically include the absolutely best explanation to avoid concluding "the best of a bad lot" (van Fraassen 1989, 143).

### Responses to Challenges

- Generating exhaustive sets of hypotheses may ensure reliability but often leads to uninformative or unclear hypotheses.
- Congruous versions of abduction avoid incongruence between comparative premises and absolute conclusions.

#### Modified Rule (ABD2)

Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,…, Hn of E, infer the truth of that Hi which explains E best, provided Hi is satisfactory/good enough qua explanation.

#### Symmetric Version (ABD3)

Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,…, Hn of E, if Hi explains E better than any other hypothesis, infer that Hi is closer to the truth than any other hypothesis.

# Status of Abduction

## Criticisms

### Argument of the Bad Lot

- Invalid against congruous rules of abduction.

### Van Fraassen's Objections

1. More explanatory theories must be more informative but less likely to be true.
   - Counterexample: Special Relativity Theory vs. Lorentz’s æther theory.
2. Probabilistic versions of abduction either amount to Bayes’ rule (redundant) or are probabilistically incoherent.
   - Patrick Maher (1992) and Brian Skyrms (1993) argue that benefits in one respect may outweigh losses in another.
   - Douven (1999) suggests coherence should be understood as a property of packages of epistemic and decision-theoretic rules.

## Defenses

### Boyd's Argument

- Scientific methodology relies on already accepted theories.
- The reliability of this methodology is best explained by assuming these theories are approximately true.
- Critics accuse Boyd's argument of being circular.
- Stathis Psillos distinguishes premise-circularity from rule-circularity, arguing that Boyd's argument is the latter and not viciously circular.

### Enumerative Induction

- Every newly recorded successful application of abduction adds support to its reliability, akin to observing black ravens supporting the hypothesis that all ravens are black.

# Abduction versus Bayesian Confirmation Theory

- Bayesian confirmation theory dominates discussions on confirmation but does not reference the concept of explanation.
- Several authors argue that abduction is compatible with Bayesianism and supplements it.
- Bayesians should determine prior probabilities and likelihoods based on explanatory considerations (Lipton 2004).

# The Core Idea of Abduction and Its Challenges

## Introduction to Abduction

Precise statements of what **abduction** amounts to are rare in the literature on abduction. Its core idea is often said to be that explanatory considerations have **confirmation-theoretic import**, or that explanatory success is a (not necessarily unfailing) mark of truth. Clearly, however, these formulations are slogans at best, and it takes little effort to see that they can be cashed out in a great variety of prima facie plausible ways. Here we will consider a number of such possible explications, starting with what one might term the “textbook version of abduction,” which, as will be seen, is manifestly defective, and then going on to consider various possible refinements of it.

### Textbook Version of Abduction

In textbooks on **epistemology** or the philosophy of science, one often encounters something like the following as a formulation of abduction:

**ABD1**
    Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,…, Hn of E, infer the truth of that Hi which best explains E.

An observation that is frequently made about this rule, and that points to a potential problem for it, is that it presupposes the notions of **candidate explanation** and **best explanation**, neither of which has a straightforward interpretation. While some still hope that the former can be spelled out in purely logical, or at least purely formal, terms, it is often said that the latter must appeal to the so-called **theoretical virtues**, like simplicity, generality, and coherence with well-established theories; the best explanation would then be the hypothesis which, on balance, does best with respect to these virtues.

## Criticisms of ABD1

Furthermore, many of those who think ABD1 is headed along the right lines believe that it is too strong. Some think that abduction warrants an inference only to the probable truth of the best explanation, others that it warrants an inference only to the approximate truth of the best explanation, and still others that it warrants an inference only to the probable approximate truth.

The real problem with ABD1 runs deeper than this. Because abduction is ampliative—as explained earlier—it will not be a sound rule of inference in the strict logical sense, however abduction is explicated exactly. It can still be reliable in that it mostly leads to a true conclusion whenever the premises are true. An obvious necessary condition for ABD1 to be reliable in this sense is that, mostly, when it is true that H best explains E, and E is true, then H is true as well (or H is approximately true, or probably true, or probably approximately true).

But this would not be enough for ABD1 to be reliable. For ABD1 takes as its premise only that some hypothesis is the best explanation of the evidence as compared to other hypotheses in a given set. Thus, if the rule is to be reliable, it must hold that, at least typically, the best explanation relative to the set of hypotheses that we consider would also come out as being best in comparison with any other hypotheses that we might have conceived.

## Responses to the "Bad Lot" Argument

How reasonable is it to suppose that this extra requirement is usually fulfilled? Not at all, presumably. To believe otherwise, we must assume some sort of privilege on our part to the effect that when we consider possible explanations of the data, we are somehow predisposed to hit, inter alia, upon the absolutely best explanation of those data.

A more promising response to the above “argument of the bad lot” begins with the observation that the argument capitalizes on a peculiar asymmetry or incongruence in ABD1. The rule gives license to an absolute conclusion—that a given hypothesis is true—on the basis of a comparative premise, namely, that that particular hypothesis is the best explanation of the evidence relative to the other hypotheses available.

### Modifications of ABD1

The first option is to modify the rule so as to have it require an absolute premise. For instance, following Alan Musgrave (1988) or Peter Lipton (1993), one may require the hypothesis whose truth is inferred to be not only the best of the available potential explanations, but also to be satisfactory (Musgrave) or good enough (Lipton), yielding the following variant of ABD1:

**ABD2**
    Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,…, Hn of E, infer the truth of that Hi which explains E best, provided Hi is satisfactory/good enough qua explanation.

Secondly, one can formulate a symmetric or congruous version of abduction by having it sanction, given a comparative premise, only a comparative conclusion; this option, too, can in turn be realized in more than one way.

**ABD3**
    Given evidence E and candidate explanations H1,…, Hn of E, if Hi explains E better than any of the other hypotheses, infer that Hi is closer to the truth than any of the other hypotheses.

## Empirical Considerations

Even if it is true that we routinely rely on abductive reasoning, it may still be asked whether this practice is rational. Experimental studies have shown that when people are able to think of an explanation for some possible event, they tend to overestimate the likelihood that this event will actually occur.

# Criticisms and Defenses of Abduction

## Criticisms

We here consider two objections that are meant to be more general. The first even purports to challenge the core idea underlying abduction; the second is not quite as general, but it is still meant to undermine a broad class of candidate explications of abduction. Both objections are due to Bas van Fraassen.

### First Objection

The first objection has as a premise that it is part of the meaning of “explanation” that if one theory is more explanatory than another, the former must be more informative than the latter.

### Second Objection

The second objection, proffered in van Fraassen 1989 (Ch. 6), is levelled at probabilistic versions of abduction. The objection is that such rules must either amount to Bayes’ rule, and thus be redundant, or be at variance with it but then, on the grounds of Lewis’ dynamic Dutch book argument, be probabilistically incoherent.

## Defenses

Hardly anyone nowadays would want to subscribe to a conception of truth that posits a necessary connection between explanatory force and truth—for instance, because it stipulates explanatory superiority to be necessary for truth. As a result, a priori defenses of abduction seem out of the question.

### Boyd's Argument

The best-known argument of this sort was developed by Richard Boyd in the 1980s. It starts by underlining the theory-dependency of scientific methodology, which comprises methods for designing experiments, for assessing data, for choosing between rival hypotheses, and so on. Boyd then argues that the reliability of scientific methodology is best explained by assuming that the theories on which it relies are at least approximately true.

Critics have accused this argument of being circular. Specifically, it has been said that the argument rests on a premise—that scientific methodology is informed by approximately true background theories—which in turn rests on an inference to the best explanation for its plausibility.

# Abduction versus Bayesian Confirmation Theory

In the past decade, Bayesian confirmation theory has firmly established itself as the dominant view on confirmation. Abduction, in whichever version, assigns a confirmation-theoretic role to explanation: explanatory considerations contribute to making some hypotheses more credible, and others less so. By contrast, Bayesian confirmation theory makes no reference at all to the concept of explanation.

Several authors have recently argued that not only is abduction compatible with Bayesianism, it is a much-needed supplement to it. The so far fullest defense of this view has been given by Lipton (2004, Ch. 7); as he puts it, Bayesians should also be “explanationists.”

## How Explanatory Considerations Guide Priors

Exactly how are explanatory considerations to guide one’s choice of priors? An obvious answer may seem to go like this: Whatever exact priors you are going to assign, you should assign a higher one to the hypothesis that explains the available data best than to any of its rivals (provided there is a best explanation).

A more interesting answer to the above question of how explanation is to guide one’s choice of priors has been given by Jonathan Weisberg (2009). Mainstream Bayesians regard one assignment of prior probabilities as being as good as any other. Objective Bayesians do not do so, however. These Bayesians think priors must obey principles beyond the probability axioms in order to be admissible. Weisberg’s proposal amounts to the claim that explanatory considerations may favor some of those partitions over others.

Another suggestion about the connection between abduction and Bayesian reasoning is that the explanatory considerations may serve as a heuristic to determine, even if only roughly, priors and likelihoods in cases in which we would otherwise be clueless and could do no better than guessing.

# Finally: A New Perspective on Abduction and Bayesianism

## The Unexplored Possibility

Finally, a possibility that has so far not been considered in the literature is that **abduction** and **Bayesianism** do not so much work in tandem—as they do on the above proposals—as operate in different modes of reasoning; the Bayesian and the explanationist are characters that feature in different plays, so to speak.

## Categorical vs. Graded Beliefs

It is widely accepted that sometimes we speak and think about our beliefs in a **categorical manner**, while at other times we speak and think about them in a **graded way**. It is far from clear how these different ways of speaking and thinking about beliefs—the **epistemology of belief** and the **epistemology of degrees of belief**, to use Richard Foley’s (1992) terminology—are related to one another. In fact, it is an open question whether there is any straightforward connection between the two, or even whether there is a connection at all.

### The Denial of Connection

Be that as it may, given that the distinction is undeniable, it is a plausible suggestion that, just as there are different ways of talking and thinking about beliefs, there are different ways of talking and thinking about the revision of beliefs.

## Different Modes of Reasoning

In particular, **abduction** could well have its home in the **epistemology of belief**, and be called upon whenever we reason about our beliefs in a categorical mode, while at the same time **Bayes’ rule** could have its home in the **epistemology of degrees of belief**.

### Bayesian Justification

Hard-nosed Bayesians may insist that whatever reasoning goes on in the categorical mode must eventually be justifiable in Bayesian terms, but this presupposes the existence of bridge principles connecting the **epistemology of belief** with the **epistemology of degrees of belief**—and, as mentioned, whether such principles exist is presently unclear.
